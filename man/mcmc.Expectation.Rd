\title{Unconditional Expectation for Pareto/GGG, Pareto/NBD (HB) and Pareto/NBD (Abe)}
\usage{
mcmc.Expectation(draws, t, sample_size = 10000)
}
\arguments{
\item{draws}{MCMC draws as returned by
\code{\link{pnbd.mcmc.DrawParameters}}, 
\code{\link{pggg.mcmc.DrawParameters}} or
\code{\link{abe.mcmc.DrawParameters}}}

\item{t}{Length of time for which we are calculating the expected number of 
transactions. May also be a vector.}

\item{sample_size}{Sample size for estimating the probability distribution.}
}
\value{
Number of repeat transactions a customer is expected to make in a
  time period of length t.
}
\description{
Uses model parameter draws to return the expected number of repeat
transactions that a randomly chosen customer (for whom we have no prior
information) is expected to make in a given time period. \deqn{E(X(t))}.
}
\details{
The expected transactions need to be sampled. Due to this sampling, the
return result varies from one call to another. Larger values of
\code{sample_size} will generate more stable results.
}
\examples{
cbs <- cdnow.sample()$cbs # load CDNow summary data
param.draws <- pnbd.mcmc.DrawParameters(cbs, 
  mcmc = 200, burnin = 100, thin = 20, chains = 1) # short MCMC runs for demo purposes
mcmc.Expectation(param.draws, t = c(26, 52))

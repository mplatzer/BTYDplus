\title{Probability Mass Function for Pareto/GGG, Pareto/NBD (HB) and Pareto/NBD (Abe)}
\usage{
mcmc.pmf(draws, t, x, sample_size = 10000)
}
\arguments{
\item{draws}{MCMC draws as returned by \code{*.mcmc.DrawParameters}}

\item{t}{Length of time for which we are calculating the expected number of
transactions. May also be a vector.}

\item{x}{Number of transactions for which probability is calculated. May also
be a vector.}

\item{sample_size}{Sample size for estimating the probability distribution.}
}
\value{
\eqn{P(X(t)=x)}. If either \code{t} or \code{x} is a vector, then the
  output will be a vector as well. If both are vectors, the output will be a
  matrix.
}
\description{
Return the probability distribution of purchase frequencies for a random
customer in a given time period, i.e. \eqn{P(X(t)=x)}. This is estimated by
generating \code{sample_size} number of random customers that follow the
provided parameter draws. Due to this sampling, the return result varies from
one call to another.

\examples{
data("groceryElog")
cbs <- elog2cbs(groceryElog)
param.draws <- pnbd.mcmc.DrawParameters(cbs,
  mcmc = 200, burnin = 100, thin = 20, chains = 1) # short MCMC to run demo fast
mcmc.pmf(param.draws, t = 52, x = 0:6)
mcmc.pmf(param.draws, t = c(26, 52), x = 0:6)

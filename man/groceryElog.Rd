\description{
These data came from an online retailer offering a broad range of grocery 
categories. The original data set spans four years, but lacked the customers'
acquisition date. Therefore, we constructed a quasi cohort by limiting the 
provided data analysis to those customers who haven't purchased at all in the
first two years, and had their first purchase in the first quarter of 2006. 
This resulted in 10483 transactions being recorded for 1525 customers during 
a period of two years (2006-2007).

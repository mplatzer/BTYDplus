Title: Probabilistic Models for Assessing and Predicting your Customer Base
Version: 1.1.4
Authors@R: person("Michael", "Platzer", email = "michael.platzer@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides advanced statistical methods to describe and predict customers'
  purchase behavior in a non-contractual setting. It uses historic transaction records to fit a
  probabilistic model, which then allows to compute quantities of managerial interest on a cohort-
  as well as on a customer level (Customer Lifetime Value, Customer Equity, P(alive), etc.). This
  package complements the BTYD package by providing several additional buy-till-you-die models, that
  have been published in the marketing literature, but whose implementation are complex and non-trivial.
  These models are: NBD, MBG/NBD, BG/CNBD-k, MBG/CNBD-k, Pareto/NBD (HB), Pareto/NBD (Abe) and Pareto/GGG.

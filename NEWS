Changes in version 0.x.x (2016-xx-xx):

    o   allow flexible sample size in `mcmc.DrawFutureTransactions`
    
    o   removed GammaGompertz/NBD due to broken `ggnbd.ConditionalExpectedTransactions`

Changes in version 0.7.2 (2016-09-07):

    o   added new methods: `elog2inc`, `elog2cum`, `cdnow.sample`
    
    o   improved documentation and demos

Changes in version 0.7.1 (2016-09-06):

    o   `elog2cbs` now returns sum over sales for calibration and holdout period

    o   enhanced CDNow demo with estimating of monetary component (i.e. CLV estimate)

    o   methods accepting `params` check for names, if named vectors are passed
    
Changes in version 0.7.0 (2016-04-19):

    o   `ggnbd.ConditionalExpectedTransactions` disabled

    o   (m)bgcnbd.ConditionalExpectedTransactions uses same h2f1 method as BTYD, if GSL is not present

    o   added Travis-CI
    
    o   formatted R code with `formatR::tidy_dir('R', indent=2)`

Changes in version 0.6.4 (2016-02-23):

    o   (m)bgcnbd.GenerateData can now handle multiple holdout period lengths, and differing calibration periods for each customer

    o   fixed bias in (m)bgcnbd.ConditionalExpectedTransactions by re-scaling via (m)bgcnbd.Expectation

Changes in version 0.6.3 (2016-02-19):

    o   unconditional expectations for (M)BG/CNBD-k (`(m)bgcnbd.Expectation`) are now calculated `exact` by utilizing `(m)bgcnbd.pmf`

Changes in version 0.6.1 (2016-02-16):

    o   added implementation of:
        (m)bgcnbd.Expectation
        (m)bgcnbd.PlotFrequencyInCalibration,
        (m)bgcnbd.ExpectedCumulativeTransactions,
        (m)bgcnbd.PlotTrackingCum,
        (m)bgcnbd.PlotTrackingInc

Changes in version 0.6.0 (2016-02-15):

    o   added implementation of BG/CNBD-k model

    o   (m)bgcnbd.ConditionalExpectedTransactions uses original approximation again

    o   mbgcnbd.ConditionalExpectedTransactions can now handle customers with many 
        (170+) transactions; thanks to Andrea Rumenjak for providing the patch;

Changes in version 0.5.0 (2015-06-02):

    o   renamed model from CBG/CNBD to MBG/CNBD - function prefixes changed from 
        cbgcnbd to mbgcnbd accordingly

    o   improved approximation logic for mbgcnbd.ConditionalExpectedTransactions

Changes in version 0.4.0 (2015-01-15):

    o   renamed model from Pareto/CNBD to Pareto/GGG - function prefixes changed from 
        pcnbd to pggg accordingly

    o   cust-column is assigned as names to list of level_1 CODA-objects returned by 
        MCMC drawParameter methods - this makes it easier to access these via customer ID

    o   renamed to cbgcnbd.EstimateRegularity() to estimateRegularity(), because the 
        method is not bound to CBG/CNBD-k model - added tests and demo

Changes in version 0.3.3 (2015-01-15):

    o   added mc.cores parameter to MCMC methods to explicitely set number of parallel cores to be used

    o   important bug-fix for pcnbd.mcmc.DrawParameters - draw_tau slice-samples now from correct
        log_posterior in churn case

    o   more realistic test case for P/NBD MCMC, plus minor change to handling numeric underflow
        resulting in more accurate parameter estimates

    o   pcnbd.GenerateData now correctly considers fixed parameter value for k

    o   pcnbd.GenerateData has minimum level of 0.1 for generated k's in order to avoid itt's if 0

Changes in version 0.3.2 (2014-10-07):

    o   added mcmc.setBurnin method which cuts away (additional) initial burnin steps of MCMC chains

    o   *.EstimateParameters and *.mcmc.DrawParameters now also accept data.tables as input

    o   pcnbd.mcmc.plotRegularityRateHeterogeneity: add option to plot point estimates

    o   added mcmc.PActive and mcmc.plotPActiveDiagnostic

Changes in version 0.3.1 (2014-08-20):

    o   deprecated `abe.mcmc.DrawFutureTransactions` and `pcnbd.mcmc.DrawFutureTransactions`
 in favor of newly added `mcmc.DrawFutureTransactions` method

    o   deprecated `abe.mcmc.PAlive` and `pcnbd.mcmc.PAlive`
 in favor of newly added `mcmc.PAlive` method

    o   `*.mcmc.DrawParameters` now all consistenly return sampled `z` values
 in their output

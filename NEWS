0.9.0.9000
- rename `plotSampledTimingPatterns` to `plotTimingPatterns`
- rename argument `per` to `units` for `elog2cbs` to be consistent with `difftime`
- fix `elog2cbs`: allow T.tot to be larger than max(elog$date)
- fix `elog2inc` and `elog2cum` to not report last week, if that is not complete
- only do bias correction for `mbgcnbd.ConditionalExpectedTransactions` when we can safely assume that the whole customer cohort is passed
- `abe.mcmc.DrawParameters` can now handle data.table's

0.9.0
- add argument `first` to `elog2cum` and `elog2inc`
- added AppVeyor for automated build tests on Windows
- bugfix for `elog2inc` and `elog2cum` for elogs where dates are missing
- added `groceryElog` dataset, and remove `cdnow.sample()`
- use `groceryElog` dataset for demos that can leverage regularity
- `elog2cbs` prunes columns, if `elog$sales` or `T.cal` is not provided

0.8.3
- rewrote demos
- added `plotSampledTimingPatterns` for plotting samples of timing patterns
- added `mbgnbd.EstimateParameters` to estimate MBG/NBD model

0.8.2
- improved documentation
- removed MBG/NBD methods, as these are easily accessible via the MBG/CNBD-k methods
- allow `T.star` to be a vector in `*.GenerateData` methods for MCMC models

0.8.0
- added
   * `pnbd.GenerateData`
   * `mcmc.pmf`
   * `mcmc.Expectation`
   * `mcmc.mcmc.ExpectedCumulativeTransactions`
   * `mcmc.PlotTrackingCum`
   * `mcmc.PlotTrackingInc`
   * `mcmc.PlotFrequencyInCalibration`
- adapted `bgcnbd.pmf` to return matrix in case that both `t` and `x` are vectors
- dropped unnecessary `cal.cbs` argument from `mcmc.PAlive`
- allow flexible sample size in `mcmc.DrawFutureTransactions`
- removed GammaGompertz/NBD due to broken `ggnbd.ConditionalExpectedTransactions`

0.7.2
- added new methods: `elog2inc`, `elog2cum`, `cdnow.sample`
- improved documentation and demos

0.7.1
- `elog2cbs` now returns sum over sales for calibration and holdout period
- enhanced CDNow demo with estimating of monetary component (i.e. CLV estimate)
- methods accepting `params` check for names, if named vectors are passed

0.7.0
- `ggnbd.ConditionalExpectedTransactions` disabled
- (m)bgcnbd.ConditionalExpectedTransactions uses same h2f1 method as BTYD, if GSL is not present
- added Travis-CI
- formatted R code with `formatR::tidy_dir('R', indent=2)`

0.6.4
- (m)bgcnbd.GenerateData can now handle multiple holdout period lengths, and differing calibration periods for each customer
- fixed bias in (m)bgcnbd.ConditionalExpectedTransactions by re-scaling via (m)bgcnbd.Expectation

0.6.3
- unconditional expectations for (M)BG/CNBD-k (`(m)bgcnbd.Expectation`) are now calculated `exact` by utilizing `(m)bgcnbd.pmf`

0.6.1
- added implementation of:
 (m)bgcnbd.Expectation
 (m)bgcnbd.PlotFrequencyInCalibration,
 (m)bgcnbd.ExpectedCumulativeTransactions,
 (m)bgcnbd.PlotTrackingCum,
 (m)bgcnbd.PlotTrackingInc

0.6.0
- added implementation of BG/CNBD-k model
- (m)bgcnbd.ConditionalExpectedTransactions uses original approximation again
- mbgcnbd.ConditionalExpectedTransactions can now handle customers with many (170+) transactions; thanks to Andrea Rumenjak for providing the patch;

0.5.0
- renamed model from CBG/CNBD to MBG/CNBD - function prefixes changed from cbgcnbd to mbgcnbd accordingly
- improved approximation logic for mbgcnbd.ConditionalExpectedTransactions

0.4.0
- renamed model from Pareto/CNBD to Pareto/GGG - function prefixes changed from pcnbd to pggg accordingly
- cust-column is assigned as names to list of level_1 CODA-objects returned by MCMC drawParameter methods - this makes it easier to access these via customer ID
- renamed to cbgcnbd.EstimateRegularity() to estimateRegularity(), because the method is not bound to CBG/CNBD-k model - added tests and demo

0.3.3
- added mc.cores parameter to MCMC methods to explicitely set number of parallel cores to be used
- important bug-fix for pcnbd.mcmc.DrawParameters - draw_tau slice-samples now from correct log_posterior in churn case
- more realistic test case for P/NBD MCMC, plus minor change to handling numeric underflow
 resulting in more accurate parameter estimates
- pcnbd.GenerateData now correctly considers fixed parameter value for k
- pcnbd.GenerateData has minimum level of 0.1 for generated k's in order to avoid itt's if 0

0.3.2
- added mcmc.setBurnin method which cuts away (additional) initial burnin steps of MCMC chains
- `*.EstimateParameters` and `*.mcmc.DrawParameters` now also accept data.tables as input
- pcnbd.mcmc.plotRegularityRateHeterogeneity: add option to plot point estimates
- added mcmc.PActive and mcmc.plotPActiveDiagnostic

0.3.1
- deprecated `abe.mcmc.DrawFutureTransactions` and `pcnbd.mcmc.DrawFutureTransactions` in favor of newly added `mcmc.DrawFutureTransactions` method
- deprecated `abe.mcmc.PAlive` and `pcnbd.mcmc.PAlive` in favor of newly added `mcmc.PAlive` method
- `*.mcmc.DrawParameters` now all consistenly return sampled `z` values in their output
